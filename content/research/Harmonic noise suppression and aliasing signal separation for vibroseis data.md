title: "Harmonic noise suppression and aliasing signal separation for vibroseis data"
subtitle: ""
summary: We present a multiscale fusion network with shot record attention (MFNSR) module, which can construct velocity models directly from the original seismic record. The proposed network can obtain fine-grained complete semantic information in the shot record by multilayer fusion operation.

### <center>Harmonic noise suppression and aliasing signal separation for vibroseis data<center>

 <font color=black> ● A joint special noise suppressing technology for vibroseis data after cross-correlation is proposed based on the characteristics of the two kinds of special noise, in which the harmonic noise is firstly suppressed by the predictive filtering method based on a feedback system, and then the surface response noise is suppressed by the frequency division method.</font><br />    
 <font color=black> ● Different techniques are used for vibroseis aliasing data acquired from different acquisition methods.</font>
