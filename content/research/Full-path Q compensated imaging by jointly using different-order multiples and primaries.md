title: "Full-path Q compensated imaging by jointly using different-order multiples and primaries"
subtitle: ""
summary: Based on a preceding operators our QLSRTM-VA method increases the imaging resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and amplitude preservation in deep regions. Our method is capable of producing better images than viscoacoustic isotropic least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) and acoustic anisotropic LSRTM.
