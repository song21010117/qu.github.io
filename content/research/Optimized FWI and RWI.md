title: "Optimized FWI and RWI"
subtitle: ""
summary: An EFWI method in the curvilinear system is presented to invert velocities for areas with surface topography. This method meshes the regions near the surface topography into body-fitted grids, and areas off surface regions into rectangular grids.
