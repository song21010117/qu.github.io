title: "Imaging and velocity inversion methods of jointly using prismatic wave and primaries for imaging steeply dipping structures"
subtitle: ""
summary: A Q -compensated LSRTM ( Q -LSRTM)-P method is proposed by deriving Q -compensated forward-propagated operators and backward-propagated adjoint operators of prismatic waves, which compensates for Q attenuation along all the three propagation paths of prismatic waves.
